###  Internship Project Submission

##  Project Description

This project demonstrates how to integrate public APIs and visualize real-time data using Python. The focus is on retrieving weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displaying it through clear, insightful visualizations. The project provides users with a way to better understand weather trends by representing temperature and humidity metrics graphically.

Whether you're developing smart farming applications, building tools for weather tracking, or simply learning API usage in Python, this project is a practical and hands-on guide.

##  Problem Statement

Weather information is crucial in numerous domains such as agriculture, transportation, education, and climate research. However, raw JSON responses from APIs can be hard to read and interpret. The aim of this project is to bridge that gap by transforming weather data into user-friendly visual plots using Python's powerful data visualization libraries.

---

##  Objectives

* Fetch real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API
* Parse and extract useful data from JSON format
* Visualize key metrics such as temperature and humidity over time
* Deliver clear, attractive, and informative graphs

---

##  Key Features

* Retrieves 5-day weather forecast with 3-hour intervals
* Supports any city input (by modifying the script)
* Converts UNIX timestamps to readable date-time format
* Plots:

  * Temperature (in °C) over time
  * Humidity (%) over time
* Visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib
* Fully standalone Python script with no external UI or server

---

##  Technologies Used

* **Python 3.7+**
* **Requests** (for HTTP API communication)
* **Seaborn** (for enhanced plotting aesthetics)
* **Matplotlib** (for plotting and rendering graphs)
* **JSON** (for parsing structured API responses)

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/API_Integration_Data_Visualization.git
cd API_Integration_Data_Visualization
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install requests matplotlib seaborn
```

### 3. Get a Free API Key

* Sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Go to API Keys section and copy your unique key

### 4. Update the Script

Edit `weather_dashboard.py` and replace:

```python
API_KEY = 'your_openweathermap_api_key'
```

### 5. Run the Script

```bash
python weather_dashboard.py
```

A graph window will appear showing temperature and humidity trends for the next 5 days.

## Sample Visualization

You will see two plots:

*  Temperature over Time
*  Humidity over Time

The graphs are color-coded, neatly styled with Seaborn, and have clear x/y-axis labels and legends for easy interpretation.

##  Sample Use Cases

*  **IoT & Smart Agriculture**: Optimize irrigation based on temperature and humidity
*  **Academic Learning**: Help students understand weather forecasting and plotting
*  **Climate Analytics**: Use trends to monitor changing environmental conditions
*  **API Education**: Teach how to use REST APIs in real-world projects

---

##  Learning Outcomes

* Master API requests and response handling using the `requests` library
* Understand JSON parsing and data extraction
* Learn datetime conversions and timestamp formatting
* Gain proficiency with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for scientific visualization
* Learn how to structure and document a Python data pipeline project

---

##  Limitations

* City must be hardcoded — no GUI or dynamic user input
* Doesn't handle network errors or API quota issues
* Graphs don’t include weather condition icons or textual descriptions
* Currently designed for personal/academic use only

---

##  Future Enhancements

* Add interactive GUI using Tkinter or PyQt
* Build a web dashboard using Streamlit
* Allow user input for city name from terminal or GUI
* Add weather icons and condition descriptions to graphs
* Save charts automatically as PNG/PDF
* Handle API limits and offline fallback using local caching

---
